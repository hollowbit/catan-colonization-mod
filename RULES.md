# Catan Colonization Mod

---

Mod for the Settlers of Catan boardgame. All you need to play is the base Catan boardgame, nothing else is required. This mod is compatible with the 5/6 player expansion as well.

Unless specified in this rulesheet, all rules in the original Catan game still apply.

## Scenario

The empires of the world have discovered a new prosperous land. With the hope of bringing riches to their empires, they send settlers to establish profitable colonies.

## Termonology Changes

| Original Term | New Term |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Road | Trade Route |
| Settlement    | Trade Post |
| City | Colony |
| Robber | No longer exists. Token becomes the Native Settlement |
| Progress Cards (Monopoly, Year of Plenty, Road Building development cards) | Colonization Packages |
| Harbour Marker | Colonial Export |
| Longest Road | Most Extensive Trade Network |
| Victory Point Cards (Library, Great Hall, etc. development cards) | Specialty Building Cards |

## Rule Changes

- Buying development cards now just means buying knights
- Harbours printed on the game board are ignored
- Multiple trade routes can be placed between intersections (see Figure 2)

![Multiple trade routes in one space](img/multiple_roads.jpg)

- To trade with a player, you must have a trade route connected to one of their trade posts or colonies
- If you run out of trade route markers, you can remove old ones to use when buying a new one
- There is no more robber. When a player rolls a 7, they get 1 free resource card of their choice. All other players with over 7 resource cards must discard until they have at most 7 resource cards in their hand
- All players can trade any resource at 3:1, instead of the default 4:1

## Game Setup

- Do not place the hexes on the inside of the island yet (see Figure 3).
- Separate 3 types of development cards
- Randomly place the Native Settlement at a hex intersection around the desert tile (pick one at random if you are using the expansion). Use a dice roll to pick which of the 6 intersections around the desert tile to place the Native Settlement on (see Figure 3). If no desert tile has been placed yet, wait for it to be discovered, then place the Native Settlement.

## Game Start

Roll to see who starts. Going clockwise, players each place 1 colony and 1 trade route. The starting colony must be placed on the outer edge of the map, next to the water. Players cannot place their colony next to a desert. Once the last player is reached, players pick 1 colonization package of their choice from those available and place 1 additional trade route, going counter-clockwise, starting with the last player.

Once all setup, all players should have:

- 1 colony
- 2 trade routes
- 1 colonization package

Give each player 2 resource cards corresponding to the tiles next to their colony. If there is only one tile next to the colony, give the player 2 of that resource.

## Rules

### Discovering Hexes

Since not all hexes are visible at game start anymore, players must explore the map by placing trade routes and building trade posts to discover what the missing hexes are. When a hex is "discovered", take one of the remaining hexes from the stack and place it there. Take a random number token from the remaining ones and place it on the new hex.

#### Discovering with trade routes

A hex can be discovered if a player builds a trade route alongside it (see Figure 4).

![Example of a hex (wood with #9) being discovered by a trade route](img/road_hex_discover.jpg)

#### Discovering with Trade Posts

A hex can be discovered if a player builds a Trade Post on a hex intersection adjacent to the it (see Figure 5).

### Imperial Stimulus

To aid struggling colonies, once all players, except for 2, have built their first trade post, the 2 who have not yet built their trade post will each receive 1 of the remaining Colonization Packages. If playing with the 5/6 player expansion, do the same except with the remaining 3 players.

### Native Settlement

Connecting a trade route to a Native Settlement lets you buy knights for 1 ore and 1 sheep each. Unlike Trade Posts and Colonies, you do not need to follow the Distance Rule with native settlements.

### Colonial Export

When you establish your first trade post, you can select one of the available Colonial Exports to the empire. Every time you build a new trade post, you can change your Colonial Export from the remaining available ones.

### Specialty Building Cards

Each colony can have 1 specialty building attached to it. Buy them for 2 wood and 3 brick. When a player buys one, they can pick which specialty building card they want and attach a Trade Post marker to the colony (see Figure 6). They are worth 1 VP each. Maximum of 5 available.

### Most Extensive Trade Network

The player whose trade routes connect to the most trade posts and colonies belonging to other players, with a minimum of 2, gets awarded with this card. The Native Settlement counts in the trade network as well.

### Blockade

At the end of their turn, players can attempt to create a blockade with a trade route they own, meaning other players cannot trade with other players or the Native Settlement, unless they are connected by a different trade route.

#### Blockade Battles

The player trying to create the blockade is the "attacker". The other players with trade routes there are the "defenders". The defending player with the largest army (most knights) will battle with the attacker. The attacker and defender do one dice roll for each knight they have, plus 1 extra dice roll for the defender. Sum the dice roles for each. Whoever has the highest count wins. Attacker wins ties. If the attacker wins, a blockade is placed (see Figure 7). Win or lose, the attacker loses 1 knight. If the defender wins, nothing happens.

![Blockade Example](img/blockade.jpg)

Players can attack a blockade on their trade route at the end of their turn by entering a blockade battle. Same rules as when attempting to make a blockade, except the player defending the blockade wins ties and the player attacking the blockade gets an extra dice role. If the attacker wins, the blockade is removed and the blockading trade route marker is placed back to the way it originally was. If the blockade owner wins, the blockade stays. Players can offer to remove blockades as part of a trade. Blockade owners may even charge players tarifs to allow trade to continue.

#### Blockades and Trade Networks

Since blockades prevent trades, it only makes sense that it should affect the Most Extensive Trade Network. Once a blockade is placed, trade networks should be recalculated to determine if another player should now receive this card.
