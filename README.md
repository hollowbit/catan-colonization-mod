# Catan Colonization Mod
Mod for the Settlers of Catan boardgame. All you need to play is the base Catan boardgame, nothing else is required. This mod is compatible with the 5/6 player expansion as well.

## Rules

Rules can be read in [RULES.md](RULES.md).

### Building Rules Documents
You can generate a PDF of the rules by running `./buildpdf.sh`. This requires `pandoc` and a tex application (On Arch Linux I use `texlive-core`).
